<p>
  Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets,
  typically baked in the oven. The pasta is alternated with a rich tomato-based
  meat sauce, often made from ground beef or pork, along with a creamy béchamel
  or ricotta cheese mixture. Between the layers, shredded mozzarella and
  Parmesan cheese are commonly added for a gooey, savory texture. The top layer
  is usually topped with extra cheese to create a golden, bubbling crust once
  baked.

  Traditional lasagna is seasoned with garlic, onions, and herbs like oregano
  and basil, giving it a deep, flavorful taste. While the classic version uses a
  meat sauce (ragù), there are many variations, including vegetarian options
  that substitute meat with vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms.
  Lasagna is a hearty, satisfying dish often served in large portions, perfect
  for family dinners or gatherings.
