<p>
  Hamburgers are a popular dish consisting of a cooked patty, usually made from
  ground beef, placed between two halves of a soft bun. The patty is often
  seasoned with salt, pepper, and additional spices for added flavor. Once
  cooked, itâ€™s commonly topped with ingredients like lettuce, tomato, onions,
  pickles, and various condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.

  Hamburgers can be customized with a variety of toppings, including cheese,
  which transforms the dish into a cheeseburger. Other toppings include bacon,
  avocado, fried eggs, or different types of sauces. Hamburgers are typically
  grilled, pan-fried, or cooked on a flat-top grill and are a staple in casual
  dining, fast food, and backyard barbecues. There are also alternative
  variations such as veggie burgers and turkey burgers for those looking for
  non-beef options.
