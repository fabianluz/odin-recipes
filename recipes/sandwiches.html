<p>
  Sandwiches are a versatile and convenient meal option, typically made by
  placing various fillings between two slices of bread. The fillings can range
  from cold cuts, like ham and turkey, to spreads such as peanut butter or
  hummus, making sandwiches customizable for any taste or dietary preference.
  Popular sandwiches include the classic BLT (bacon, lettuce, and tomato),
  turkey club, and grilled cheese.

  Sandwiches can be served cold, like a deli-style sandwich, or hot, like a
  grilled or toasted sandwich. They are often accompanied by condiments like
  mustard, mayonnaise, or butter, and can include additional ingredients such as
  lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese. The type of bread used can also vary,
  ranging from white and whole grain to baguettes and ciabatta.
